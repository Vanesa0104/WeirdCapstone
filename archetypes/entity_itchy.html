      She presses a hand to her arm, where red patches have bloomed beneath her sleeve—raw, raised, and burning. The itch intensifies, but it’s not just on the surface anymore. It writhes under her skin, like it’s clawing its way to the surface. Like it’s something alive.

      <br></br>

        She bites the inside of her cheek to keep from clawing at it.

        <br></br>

        It isn’t just a flare-up. This feels… wrong.

        <br></br>

        Invasive.

        <br></br>

        A wave of nausea rises in her. Her breaths come shallow. She squeezes her eyes shut. Tries to ground herself—dirt under her boots, the faint echo of footsteps ahead. But the sensation keeps creeping back.

        <br></br>

        She curls into herself, trying to shut out the rest of the world. The burning in her arms, the pressure under her skin—it’s all too much.

        <br></br>

        A scream cuts through the haze.

        <br></br>

        <em>Elena?</em>

        <br></br>

        It comes again—raw, high-pitched. Pleading.

        <br></br>

        <em>Elena!</em>

        <br></br>

        Her eyes fly open.

      <br></br>
      
      “Elena!” Theodosia cries, searching wildly for her 
      friend, “Elena, where–!”

      <br></br>

      She freezes.

      <br></br>

      <em>N-no...</em>

      <br></br>
      Horrified, Theodosia brings her hands up to her mouth, her 
      stomach lurching.  

      <br></br>

      Only…. She looks down and realizes her hands are... stained. 
      Stained red. And in her mouth, the taste of copper lingers.

      <br></br>

      Slowly, she feels herself crouching down beside her friend. 
      She strains herself, trying to move away from her but finds she 
      can’t. She feels like a passenger in her own body, as though 
      <em>something</em> is imposing its will on her. Controlling her. 
      Resisting feels like she’s shouldering the weight of the sky. 

      <br></br>

      Sobbing, Theodosia is forced to bring her face next to her 
      friend’s corpse, her liver. 

      <br></br>

      The itch <em>burns</em>.

      <br></br>

      Against her will, she feasts on her friend. Against her will, 
      she savours every bite.

      <br></br>

      She looks up and finds a bird perched on the statue.  

      <br></br>

      Silent. Watching her.

      <br></br>
