      She presses a hand to her arm, where red patches have bloomed beneath her sleeveâ€”raw, raised, 
and burning. The itch intensifies, but itâ€™s not just on the surface anymore. It writhes under her skin, 
like itâ€™s clawing its way to the surface. Like itâ€™s something alive.

      <br></br>

        She bites the inside of her cheek to keep from clawing at it.

        <br></br>

        It isnâ€™t just a flare-up. This feelsâ€¦ wrong.

        <br></br>

        Invasive.

        <br></br>

        A wave of nausea rises in her. Her breaths come shallow. She squeezes her eyes shut. Tries to ground herselfâ€”dirt under her boots, the faint echo of footsteps ahead. But the sensation keeps creeping back.

        <br></br>

        She curls into herself, trying to shut out the rest of the world. The burning in her arms, the pressure under her skinâ€”itâ€™s all too much.

        <br></br>

        A scream cuts through the haze.

        <br></br>

        <em>Elena?</em>

        <br></br>

        It comes againâ€”raw, high-pitched. Pleading.

        <br></br>

        <em>Elena!</em>
